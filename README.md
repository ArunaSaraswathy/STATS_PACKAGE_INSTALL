# STATS_PACKAGE_INSTALL
It installs Python or R modules needed by a begin program block or an extension command whose install did not install them. This will make this process easier than the current means and reduce the difficulty of installing packages that need items from PyPI or CRAN. It is not uncommon for CRAN packages not to list all their dependencies.
